# BreadBoard Projects - XxVinc07xX

Until now, the projects in this repo uses some leds on a breadbord connected on a raspberry pi to perform multiple things

## Setup - Ubuntu

You'll need `gpiozero`. It is by default installed on the raspberry but not on your laptop.
Here's the command to install it on your Ubuntu machine : 

```sh
$ sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

## Projects

Let's review the already implemented projects!

### Binary Clock
You'll find here an implementation of a binary clock. 
You'll need : 
- 17 leds (5 ford hours, 6 for minutes and seconds)

### Number Guesser
From a personal observation, I've understood that my binary counting was not smooth enough so I decided to implement a binary counting game.
You'll need : 
- 7 leds

You'll be able to count until 255 with this game.

## Note

Don't be afraid to make pull-request to complete this project or suggest me some improvements.
